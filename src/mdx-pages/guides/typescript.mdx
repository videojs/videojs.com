description: Using Video.js with Typescript.
---

Starting with Video.js 8.0, types are included in the npm package. This documentation are for the included types. If you are using 7.0 or below you can use the [DefinitelyTyped](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/video.js) package and see their documentation.

## Usage

In general, you should be able to use Video.js with Typescript without any extra steps. If you are using advanced features of video.js you might need to pull in some internal types. You can find them in the `video.js/dist/types` package.

```ts
// A few examples

import type Player from 'video.js/dist/types/player';
import type Plugin from 'video.js/dist/types/plugin';
import type Component, {ComponentOptions} from 'video.js/dist/types/component';
```

## Plugins

If you are writing a plugin, you can use module augmentation to add types to the `videojs` namespace.

```ts
declare module 'video.js/dist/types/player' {
  interface Player {
    // videojs-contrib-quality-levels
    qualityLevels: {
      VERSION: string;
      (): QualityLevelList;
    };
  }
}
```
