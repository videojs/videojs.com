Video.js and official libraries and plugins all work in a Webpack-based build environment. These are several configuration changes specific to Webpack that will get you up and running.

## Video.js CSS:

To add the CSS that the player requires, add the following to the file where the player is also included or initialized:

```js
require('!style-loader!css-loader!video.js/dist/video-js.css')
```

## Using Webpack with Video.js HTTP Streaming

Import the HLS library with a line such as:

```sh
import * as HLS from '@videojs/http-streaming';
```

In order to use VHS, support for Web Workers is required. This can be done with the package 'webworkify-webpack-dropin':

```sh
npm install --save-dev webworkify-webpack-dropin
```

Create an alias in your `webpack.config.js` file with:

```js
resolve: {
  alias: {
    webworkify: 'webworkify-webpack-dropin'
  }
}
```

Source maps that use the `'eval'` tag are not compatible with webworkify, so this may need to be changed. Source maps such as `'cheap-eval-module-source-map'` should be changed to `'cheap-source-map'` or anything else that fits your build without using `'eval'` source maps.
