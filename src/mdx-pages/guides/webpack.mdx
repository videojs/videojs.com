Video.js and official libraries and plugins all work in a Webpack-based build environment.

## Video.js CSS:

The only thing you may need to add to your Webpack configuration is [`style-loader`](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/).

Then add the CSS that the player requires, add the following to the file where the player is also included or initialized:

```js
require('!style-loader!css-loader!video.js/dist/video-js.css')
```
