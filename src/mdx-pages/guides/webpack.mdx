Video.js and official libraries and plugins all work in a Webpack-based build environment. These are several configuration changes specific to Webpack that will get you up and running.

## Video.js CSS:

To add the CSS that the player requires, add the following to the file where the player is also included or initialized:

```js
require('!style-loader!css-loader!video.js/dist/video-js.css')
```
