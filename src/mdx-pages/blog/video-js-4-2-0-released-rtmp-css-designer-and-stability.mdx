Happy September! The 4.2.0 release of Video.js has a few interesting updates, and a bunch of stability and polish.

## RTMP Support

First of all, thanks to an impressive collaboration of community members, we now have RTMP support (in _beta_). [Check out the example](http://jsbin.com/cayake).

It&rsquo;s still pretty basic support for RTMP, but we think it will cover a lot of the general use cases. The feature support includes:

- Single stream (no client-side adaptive support)
- Flash only, HTML5 video doesn&rsquo;t support RTMP (but HLS is supported on iOS devices)
- On-demand only. We haven&rsquo;t updated the UI to support live yet.

To load an RTMP stream in a Video.js player, you&rsquo;ll use a source tag in the same way you would other source types:

```html
<source
  src="rtmp://your.streaming.provider.net/cfx/st/&amp;mp4:path/to/video.mp4"
  type="rtmp/mp4"
/>
```

The connection and stream parts are determined by splitting the URL on the first ampersand (&amp;) or the last slash (/).

```
[http://myurl.com/streaming&amp;/is/fun](http://myurl.com/streaming&amp;/is/fun) --&gt;
  connection: [http://myurl.com/streaming](http://myurl.com/streaming)
  stream: /is/fun

-or-

[http://myurl.com/streaming/is/fun](http://myurl.com/streaming/is/fun) --&gt;
  connection: [http://myurl.com/streaming/is](http://myurl.com/streaming/is)
  stream: fun
```

The available source types include `rtmp/mp4` or `rtmp/flv`.

RTMP has been a much requested feature over the years and it&rsquo;s great to finally have it in the player. Thanks to everyone involved in that work.

## Player Skin Designer

If you missed the [previous blog post](/blog/new-player-skin-designer-for-video-js), be sure to check out the [new interface for designing the player skin](http://designer.videojs.com). It really shows off the customizability of the video.js controls, which are built completely in HTML and CSS.

With the 4.2 release the styles in the designer have been brought up-to-date with the latest player styles.

## Control Bar Updates

Also in [a previous post](/blog/new-player-skin-designer-for-video-js), I described a number of updates that were made to the control bar to fix cross browser/device issues and improve the overall functionality. As of 4.2.0 all of those updates have made it into the stable release.
