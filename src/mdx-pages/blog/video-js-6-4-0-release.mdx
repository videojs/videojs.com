Hello everyone, it's been a while! Yesterday, I pre-released Video.js 6.4.0. It's a pretty big release with 27 merged Pull Requests from 13 authors and 7 of them were contributors!
I'd like to thank everyone who contributed but particularly those seven. Six of them made their first PRs with Video.js: [@estim](https://github.com/estim), [@seggev319](https://github.com/seggev319), [@nicolaslevy](https://github.com/nicolaslevy), [@MarcAMo](https://github.com/MarcAMo), [@knilob](https://github.com/knilob), [@odisei369](https://github.com/odisei369). And [@kocoten1992](https://github.com/kocoten1992) returned with some great PRs to refactor things.

In this release, we fixed a bunch of bugs, refactored some things, updated some tests. We also added some new features.

As with other releases, this is released as `next` for a short while before being promoted to `latest`.
You can get these releases on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/releases/tag/v6.4.0) or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/video.js)

## Notable Changes
- Hebrew translations are now available. Russian and Polish translations were updated as well.
- The Progress Control can now be disabled. This is useful for when you don't want users to be able to interact with it but still want to show play progress.
  - The Progress Control will also be fully filled out when the video ends so that we aren't slightly short or long due to weirdnesses in duration and currentTime.
- It's now possible to add a `hook` that gets automatically removed once called with `hookOnce`. This mirrors our `on` and `once` event methods.
- If controls are disabled before the modal dialog is opened, the controls stay closed when the dialog is closed.
- `player.src()` will now return an empty string when no source is set to match `player.currentSrc()` and the native video element.
- Video.js will now warn when the element it is given isn't in the DOM. This was done as part of a "first-timers-only" issue which we hope to do more off in the future.

## Google Analytics note
We've updated the [README](https://github.com/videojs/video.js#quick-start) of the project to be explicit about our usage of Google Analytics on the `vjs.zencdn.net` hosted version of Video.js. It is a stripped down version of the [Google Analytics pixel](https://github.com/videojs/cdn/blob/master/src/analytics.js) and sends data on 1% of those loads.
It can be opted out of by adding the following to the page before the `zencdn`-hosted version of Video.js is loaded
```html
<script>window.HELP_IMPROVE_VIDEOJS = false;</script>
```
Our GitHub releases and npm releases *do not* include Google Analytics. Neither do 3rd-party CDNs like unpkg or CDNjs.
