We&rsquo;re continuing to work hard on improving the contributor experience around the Video.js project and it&rsquo;s paying off. Over half of the changelog is thanks to brand new contributors! Issues and pull requests are getting addressed faster than ever, and I was even allowed to give [a talk at OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/speaker/104522) on some of the strategies we&rsquo;re using. If you&rsquo;re instersted in getting involved, join the #videojs IRC room or post an issue to let us know.

## Google Chooses Video.js for Google Media Framework

Google recently [announced a new framework](http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2014/07/google-media-framework-making-online.html) for building video experiences and monetization. There are versions of the framework for native iOS and Android apps, and for the browser they chose to use Video.js. Check out [their video.js plugin](https://github.com/googleads/videojs-ima), and as it says in their announcement, &ldquo;Stay tuned as well for a deeper dive into Video.js with IMA soon!&rdquo;

## Localization

In this release we&rsquo;ve built the infrastructure for displaying text in other languages. Examples of text include error messages and text used for accessibility. This feature can extend to plugins as well.

Today you can include other languages by including the JSON translations object from the language you want with the player, like in this example for Spanish (es).

`videojs.options.languages['es'] = { [translations object] }`

You can find translations files in [the lang folder](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/tree/master/lang) of the project. We don&rsquo;t have many translations yet, but we&rsquo;re looking for translators if you&rsquo;d like to help!

## Multiple buffered regions

With HTML5 video you can skip ahead in the video and the browser will start downloading the part of the file needed for the new position, which is different from how Flash video works by default. Flash will download from the start to the end of the file so you can only skip ahead once it has download that part of the video.

In the HTML5 video API we&rsquo;re given the `buffered` property which returns a list of time ranges that the browser has downloaded data for. Early on in HTML5 video, browsers only ever reported one time range, but now we have a direct view of what&rsquo;s been downloaded.

In the newest version of the video.js skin you can see the specific regions.

We&rsquo;ve kept it subtle so it&rsquo;s not too big of a change. We&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on it.

## DASH Everywhere-ish

If you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, check out [the post](/blog/dash-everywhere-ish-hack-project/) on Tom Johson&rsquo;s work getting DASH supported in Video.js, using Flash or the new Media Source Extensions. MPEG-DASH is an adaptive streaming format that Netflix and YouTube are using to stream video to cutting-edge browsers. It has the potential to replace Apple&rsquo;s HTTP Live Streaming format as the main format used for adaptive streaming.

## Video.js on Conan!

Conan O'Brien&rsquo;s TeamCoco site is using Video.js with a nicely customized skin and ads integration. [Check it out!](http://teamcoco.com)
