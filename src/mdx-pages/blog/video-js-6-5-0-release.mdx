November 17th marked the pre-release of Video.js 6.5.0. It comes shortly after the [release of 6.4.0](/blog/video-js-6-4-0-release/), which has now been promoted to latest! This is a pretty exciting release because we finally got our own element! I like to call it the I Can't Believe It's Not Custom Elements because it isn't an actual custom element but it's not a standard HTML element either. Also, a nice and smooth progress bar thanks to a first time contributor; thanks [@vhmth](https://github.com/vhmth)!. A pretty major memory leak fix, and many code refactors and bug fixes.
I'd like to thank everyone who contributed and the four first time contributors to Video.js: [@vhmth](https://github.com/vhmth), [@FirefoxMetzger](https://github.com/FirefoxMetzger), [@EhsanCh](https://github.com/EhsanCh), and [@shahlabs](https://github.com/shahlabs).
This post comes a week late because it was Thanksgiving week in the US after release and I was on break, if you celebrate Turkey day 🦃, hope you had a good one!


## Notable Changes
* I Can't Believe It's Not Custom Elements with a `<video-js>` element. It works exactly like the `<video>` embed but without requiring you to use the `<video>` element and the benefits and drawbacks that come with it. It also adds the `video-js` class name automatically for you, so, there's no need to add it.
* A smooth progress bar!

* After much spelunking in the code base and developer tools, we've plugged most of the memory leaks with retained DOM elements in Video.js!
* Many code refactorings from our old code style to the new one by [@kocoten1992](https://github.com/kocoten1992)!
* Previously, you could accidentally seek or toggle playback using the middle or right clicks. Now, just go ahead and try it!
* An accessibility fix with regards to title tooltips and menu items.
* Better handling of `play()` in our new asynchronous world, especially immediately after changing the source.
