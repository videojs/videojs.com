After months and months of work we&rsquo;re happy to announce Video.js version 3.0\. Some of the exiting new features include:

*   Same HTML/CSS Skin for both HTML5 and Flash video
*   Super lightweight Flash fallback player for browsers that don&rsquo;t support HTML5 video
*   Free CDN hosting by Level3 A lot more releases and developments are on their way!

Cheers,<br />
