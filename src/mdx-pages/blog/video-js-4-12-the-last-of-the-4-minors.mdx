## Much improved WebVTT support

We added basic WebVTT support really early on, which we were pretty proud of. As browsers added support, however, our shim started to lag a bit, or at the very least, cause issues with browsers that required native support (here’s looking at you, iOS).

So, we’re happy to announce that our text track support is vastly improved with this version! Instead of continuing to try and build out our own WebVTT parser, we’ve pulled in Mozilla’s fantastic work, [VTT.js](https://github.com/mozilla/vtt.js). This is the WebVTT implementation used in Firefox / Gecko, so we’re confident that this is a substantial leap forward for Video.js and our accessibility efforts.

## Don’t use captions? Feeling disappointed?

You shouldn’t feel disappointed, this is a great day! This release includes a lot of fixes, and although fixes are always exciting to the people affected, other people can feel a hefty dose of “meh”. We’re excited to say, however, that this release is exciting for another, very important reason.

This is the **last minor** release in the version 4 family. There might be a few patches, but from now on, master is officially version 5.0-in-waiting. Party.

#### Notable updates and fixes for 4.12

*   The hide / show methods now toggle a class (`.vjs-hidden`) instead of applying inline styles. Make sure to update your stylesheet as well!
*   A new `.vjs-scrubbing` class gets applied while, you guessed it, scrubbing so menus can be prevented from erroneously showing on hover.
*   Improved url parsing in IE9.
*   Ever wondered what version you’re using? Now there’s a VERSION key. Woot.
*   New `.vjs-ended` class that’s added when playback reaches the end of the timeline (also known as: ended).
*   Player networkState and readyState properties available across techs
*   Video.js is now exported as a named AMD module
*   Mobile scrolling improvements
*   And more! Fixes galore!

## Translation party continues

We’re now up to **19** community submitted translations! Entirely new translations in this release include:

*   Traditional Chinese
*   Vietnamese
*   Czech
*   Catalan
*   Bulgarian
*   Turkish

## Video.js in the wild

To be terribly honest, there is a level of starstruck over a few of these. Normally we just do one, but hey…
