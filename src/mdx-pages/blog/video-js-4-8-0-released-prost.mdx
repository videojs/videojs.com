This isn&rsquo;t the flashiest minor release ever, but it&rsquo;s hot off the press and ready for use. As mentioned in the last (few) release posts, we&rsquo;re making a concerted effort to be more consistent with releases, so hopefully the trend of bite-sized, scheduled releases will continue.

### Translations

We only just released localization with [version 4.7](/blog/video-js-v4-7-0-built-mostly-by-new-contributors-also-google-chooses-video-js/), but we&rsquo;ve already had two pull-requests for new translations! The German translation is included with this release, and you&rsquo;ll find the French translation in the next patch release. If you&rsquo;re fluent in another language, you can help Video.js be even more internationally accessible by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) translating just 24 words / phrases. `</shameless_plug>`

### Video.js in the wild

[Heavybit Industries](http://www.heavybit.com/) has a speaker series they host at their office, and they&rsquo;ve been kind enough to start posting these sessions online in their [library](http://www.heavybit.com/library). The experience they&rsquo;ve built using Video.js is impressive, including syncing the video progress with a transcript below the player.

- [videojs-hdtoggle](https://github.com/Hussnain1/Video.js-HD-Toggle-Plugin): HD button which toggles between HD and non-HD source.
