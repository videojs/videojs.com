Version 4.4.0 is here with over 20 updates and fixes. The most notable addition may be support for AMD and CommonJS module loaders, meaning you can now include Video.js using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org). Video.js can be installed through [npm](http://www.npmjs.org/package/video.js) already, and we&rsquo;ll soon add support for [bower](http://bower.io) and [component(1)](http://component.io) as well.

### New plugins
