We are very excited to announce that Video.js 8.0 and Video.js HTTP Streaming (VHS) 3.0 are available! These releases bring some much needed modernization to the Video.js platform and set us up for the next generation of websites and applications.

## Contributors

Before we dive into the software changes, open source doesn't work without _people_. Huge thanks to everyone who contributed pull requests to these releases!

## What's Changed?

The first question you might ask upon installing is: what's changed? On the surface, not a whole lot, but here's what's different:

### Video.js

The [complete CHANGELOG is available](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/TODO/CHANGELOG.md), but here are some highlights:

* No longer transpiled into ES5 for compatibility with older browsers like Internet Explorer
* Updated to VHS 3.0
* Enabled the `sourceset` event by default, `enableSourceset: false` can be used to turn this off.
* Added new title bar component, which is off by default (see below for details)* Moved the `BigPlayButton` component to the center of the player by default
* `addClass` and `removeClass` methods can now be given multiple class names
* Clicking the playback rate button now opens the menu rather than changing the playback rate
* Deprecated many old top-level utility methods in favor of utility methods stored on objects (see below for details)
* Invalid event types will now throw instead of warn
* Change `addRemoteTextTrack`'s `manualCleanup` option to default to `false`
* Removed the `firstplay` event - use `one('play', fn)` instead!
* Removed the `retryOnError` option and made this behavior the default
* Removed the ability to set `aria-*`, `role`, and `type` attributes via the `props` argument of `createEl` methods
* Removed remaining references and logic related to Flash and SWF
* Remove fallbacks for missing flexbox support
* Removed IE-specific code

Overall, the minfied and gzipped size of Video.js is **reduced by around 3%**. More savings are likely available through further removal of dead code.

### VHS

The [complete CHANGELOG is available](https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming/blob/TODO/CHANGELOG.md), but here are some highlights:

* No longer transpiled into ES5 for compatibility with older browsers like Internet Explorer.
* Naming changes for more inclusive language (e.g. "master" becomes "main" and "blacklist" becomes "exclude").
* Skip detected gaps immediately instead of waiting the duration of the gap before skipping.
* Removed the deprecated `smoothQualityChange` method.
* Improved behavior when encountering `output-restricted` event handling.
* Cleaned up parameters of `excludePlaylist`.

Overall, the minfied and gzipped size of VHS is **reduced by around 4%**. More savings are likely available through further removal of dead code.

## Platform Support

With these releases, our new browser/platform targets are generally focused on the last 3 major versions of so-called "evergreen" browsers:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge (Chromium, not Legacy)

However, with Video.js being used in more contexts than just desktop and mobile web, like Smart TVs or OTT devices, we have an additional minimum support threshold for _Chromium-based browsers version 53 and newer_. This grants support for:

* [webOS TV](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/discover/specifications/web-engine/) 4.x and newer
* [Tizen](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/specifications/web-engine-specifications.html) 2018 models and newer

## New Video.js `TitleBar` Component

The new `TitleBar` component will show a UI element across the top of the player which displays the title and/or description of the current media in the player. The `TitleBar` will not show if no title or description is provided.

### Using `loadMedia` to Populate the `TitleBar`

The easiest way to provide a title and/or description is to use your player's `loadMedia` method:

```js
player.loadMedia({
  artist: 'Disney',
  album: 'Oceans',
  title: 'Oceans',
  description: 'Journey in to the depths of a wonderland filled with mystery, beauty and power. Oceans is a spectacular story, narrated by Pierce Brosnan, about remarkable creatures under the sea. It\'s an unprecedented look at the lives of these elusive deepwater creatures through their own eyes. Incredible state-of-the-art-underwater filmmaking will take your breath away as you migrate with whales, swim alongside a great white shark and race with dolphins at play.',
  poster: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png',
  src: [{
    src: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4',
    type: 'video/mp4'
  }, {
    src: 'https://vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.webm',
    type: 'video/webm'
  }]
})
```

If you're not familiar with the `loadMedia` method, it's a way to provide additional metadata for your media beyond what is available through the `src` method alone. As you see in the above example, the `title` and `description` are provided and will be used to populate the title bar.

### Populating the `TitleBar` Directly

The `TitleBar` can also be populated through direct input using the component's `update` method:

```js
player.titleBar.update({
  title: 'Oceans',
  description: 'Journey in to the depths ... and race with dolphins at play.'
});
```

The title and/or description can be removed by passing an empty string for one or both of these values:

```js
player.titleBar.update({
  title: '',
  description: ''
});
```

If both are removed, the `TitleBar` will no longer be visible.

## New Video.js Utility Objects

Over time, the `videojs` namespace has become cluttered with a wide variety of utility functions. One of the changes we are introducing is a more deliberately designed interface for these utility functions.

The guiding principle here was that if a function didn't feel like a core part of the library, but was still _potentially useful_, we exposed it as part of a utility object instead of a top-level function.

These are the utility objects attached to `videojs` in 8.0.0:

Object                | Description
----------------------|--------------------------------------
`videojs.browser`     | Various user-agent detection values (available previously)
`videojs.dom`         | DOM functions (available previously)
`videojs.fn`          | Function... functions
`videojs.num`         | Number functions
`videojs.obj`         | Object functions
`videojs.str`         | String functions
`videojs.time`        | Time-related functions
`videojs.url`         | URL-related functions

### Newly Exposed Functions on Utility Objects

These are some of the utility functions that are now exposed and were not previously exposed through another name:

* `videojs.fn.debounce`
* `videojs.fn.throttle`
* `videojs.num.clamp`
* `videojs.obj.each`
* `videojs.obj.isObject`
* `videojs.obj.isPlain`
* `videojs.obj.reduce`
* `videojs.str.titleCaseEquals`
* `videojs.str.toLowerCase`
* `videojs.str.toTitleCase`
* `videojs.url.getAbsoluteURL`
* `videojs.url.getFileExtension`

### Newly Deprecated Functions

As a result of this, many functions that were top-level in Video.js 7 and earlier have been (or remain) deprecated:

Deprecated Function          | Instead, use...
-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
`videojs.bind`               | native `Function.prototype.bind`
`videojs.computedStyle`      | `videojs.dom.computedStyle`
`videojs.createTimeRange`    | `videojs.time.createTimeRanges`
`videojs.createTimeRanges`   | `videojs.time.createTimeRanges`
`videojs.defineLazyProperty` | `videojs.obj.defineLazyProperty`
`videojs.extend`             | native ES6 classes
`videojs.formatTime`         | `videojs.time.formatTime`
`videojs.isCrossOrigin`      | `videojs.url.isCrossOrigin`
`videojs.mergeOptions`       | `videojs.obj.merge`
`videojs.parseUrl`           | `videojs.url.parseUrl`
`videojs.resetFormatTime`    | `videojs.time.resetFormatTime`
`videojs.setFormatTime`      | `videojs.time.setFormatTime`

Each of these functions will log a deprecation warning the first time they are used, but only the first time so as not to be _too_ noisy!

_These deprecated functions will be removed in Video.js 9.0!_

### Older Deprecated Functions

There are still a number of older functions that remain usable, but deprecated:

Deprecated Function     | Instead, use...
------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
`videojs.addClass`      | `videojs.dom.addClass`
`videojs.appendContent` | `videojs.dom.appendContent`
`videojs.createEl`      | `videojs.dom.createEl`
`videojs.emptyEl`       | `videojs.dom.emptyEl`
`videojs.getAttributes` | `videojs.dom.getAttributes`
`videojs.hasClass`      | `videojs.dom.hasClass`
`videojs.insertContent` | `videojs.dom.insertContent`
`videojs.isEl`          | `videojs.dom.isEl`
`videojs.isTextNode`    | `videojs.dom.isTextNode`
`videojs.plugin`        | `videojs.registerPlugin`
`videojs.removeClass`   | `videojs.dom.removeClass`
`videojs.setAttributes` | `videojs.dom.setAttributes`
`videojs.toggleClass`   | `videojs.dom.toggleClass`

_These deprecated functions will be removed in Video.js 9.0!_
