I told myself when the site reached 100,000 visits I would redesign it. Well that number&rsquo;s come and gone, so [here it is](http://videojs.com).

I also took this as an opportunity to code an HTML5 based site, using tags like `header`, `footer`, and `section`. And I built it on the newly popular [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/). Actually I built a [WordPress them for HTML5 Boilerplate](http://github.com/zencoder/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress)first, in case you&rsquo;re interested in doing the same.

I got to use some fun CSS tricks throughout as well. One of them is the thin color bar at the top of the page. Resize the window and watch it go!

I also added this blog and a [twitter account](http://twitter.com/videojs), where I&rsquo;ll be posting updates to VideoJS, as well as general HTML5 video news.
